SER401 Project 30 - NASA Psyche Mission: AR/WebXR for Public Engagement

#### Description:
The NASA Psyche mission is an orbiter mission to explore and research the metal-rich asteroid, Psyche. 
The project is a QR based AR environment designed to promote the NASA Psyche Mission and boost community engagement and education over the project. 
The project should be light enough to be used on a phone browser, intuitive enough for the general public to engage with, and disseminate information about the Psyche Mission in an understandable way. 
The QR code(s) will be based on the 3D printed model and hosted on the Psyche webpage.
