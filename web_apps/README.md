AR marker-based web applications.

To run these AR web modules:

In your terminal in the root folder of the project you are in run:
npm install express

To start the server run:
node server.js

Open localhost:8080 on your computer, allow the web camera, and use the hiro image (either printed or displayed on another device) to trigger the AR.
